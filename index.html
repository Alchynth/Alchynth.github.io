<p style="font-size:160%;">This is a turn-based RPG inspired by the Mystery Dungeon games. It utilizes a potion brewing system to make it unique, both 
using potions for combat and for menial things.<br />The code utilizes Java (of course) and also uses two external libraries. 
Those libraries being slick2d and the lightweight java game library.</p>
