<p style="font-size:160%;">Alchynth is a top of the line modern reimagining of the classic Mystery Dungeon genre, featuring immersive, state of the art 
  graphics, challenging yet rewarding combat against a multitude of unique and creative enemies, and an intuitive potion brewing system simple enough
  to understand yet complex enough to allow the user to explore the full length of their creativity and imagination, all tied together with a cutting edge audio system and lifelike
  sounds that will make you feel as if you're really there. A passion project of two of the brightest minds in the field, Alchynth aims to provide the
  ultimate Enigma Dungeon experience for newcomers and long time fans of the genre. It is all made possible using the latest in game development
  software, being made in Java and utilizing Slick2d and the LWJGL. Alchynth - it's what's for dinner. </p>
