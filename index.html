<p>This is a turn-based RPG inspired by the Mystery Dungeon games. It utilizes a potion brewing system as its differentiator, both 
using potions for combat and for menial things. The code utilizes Java to the fullest extent and also uses two external libraries. 
Those libraries being slick2d and the lightweight java game library.</p>
